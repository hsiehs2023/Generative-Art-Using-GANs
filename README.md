# Generative-Art-Using-GANs

# Project Description:
Developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create unique and visually appealing artwork. The project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and creativity, leveraging deep learning techniques to generate original art pieces that mimic various artistic styles.

# Key Features:

GAN Architecture: Utilized a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture to train the model on a diverse dataset of artwork, enabling it to produce high-quality images.
Style Transfer: Implemented style transfer techniques to blend different artistic styles, creating novel and aesthetically diverse outputs.
Custom Dataset: Curated a dataset of over 10,000 images from different art movements and styles, including impressionism, abstract, and contemporary art.
Interactive Interface: Developed a user-friendly web application allowing users to generate and customize their own art pieces by adjusting parameters such as style influence and color palette.
Real-Time Rendering: Ensured real-time rendering of generated art pieces using optimized neural network inference on a GPU-enabled server.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
GAN Libraries: TensorFlow-GAN, PyTorch-GAN
Data Processing: OpenCV for image processing and augmentation
Web Technologies: Flask for the backend server and React.js for the frontend interface
Deployment: Deployed on a cloud platform (Google Cloud) with GPU instances for efficient training and inference
